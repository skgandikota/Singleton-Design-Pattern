# Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton pattern *`restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists`* in the Java virtual machine.

## ðŸ˜¢ Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

    Ensure that a class has just a single instance

Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file.

Hereâ€™s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, youâ€™ll get the one you already created.

Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call must always return a new object by design.

    Provide a global access point to that instance.

Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While theyâ€™re very handy, theyâ€™re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.

Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.

Thereâ€™s another side to this problem: you donâ€™t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program. Itâ€™s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.
